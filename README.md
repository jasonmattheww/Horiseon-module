# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

In this challenge I recived starter code and needed to go in and edit and fix the HTML and CSS files to make the website more user friendly. In order for me to do this I used semantic HTML elements, fixed img alt attributes, made heading attributes fall in sequential order, and edited repeated CSS selectors into one selector. Now when you go onto the website all of the nav links go directly to the corresponding place in the page.
